* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience

## Decisions  

Decisions within the group will be made preferably by consensus. If there
is not a consensus, then we will go based off of the majority.

## Attendance

Attendance in class is expected of all members. In the case of extenuating 
circumstances, the member who missed the meeting will be caught up later that 
day or soon thereafter. If a meeting is to be missed, the member missing the meeting 
should reach out to the other group members prior to it beginning. All members are 
expected to pay attention to the group chat.

## Assignments

Assignments will be split up across the group evenly. We will occasionally test the product
to ensure all features work as intended and will adjust from there.

## Participation

Communication will be done through the group chat. All tasks will be evenly distributed 
throughout the course of the project.

## Meeting Times and Locations

Meetings will take place at 2pm on Wednesdays over Zoom. Reminders will be sent out 15 
minutes prior and the Zoom link will be sent over Email.

## Notes During Meetings

Notes of major points will be taken down in case someone misses a meeting. 

## Promptness

A reminder will be sent out prior to the meeting beginning. In the event someone is not present 
for the start of a meeting, we will continue on with meeting as normal. After the meeting is 
over they will be sent the notes from the meeting.

## Conversational Courtesies

Team encourage and reinforce active listening as well as respectful dialogue.

## Enforcement/ Feedback 

When giving feedback, make it constructive and be respectful while giving it.
