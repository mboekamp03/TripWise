## Observation 1:
- Observation Statement:

Most respondents expressed at least a slight willingness to try our product.

- Supporting Data:

Out of 17 total responses to the question of how willing the respondent would be to try out our product, 15 of them expressed at the very least a slight willingness to see how it works. They mentioned things such as liking the idea of a streamlined approach to planning vacations. Respondents did express slight concern about the app actually working and being helpful rather than a hindrance to the planning 
process, and also being free.

- Team Action (if any):

We will not be taking action on this observation because it is a positive one. At least to start, our appwill be free because we will not be putting any money into it. We also will be focusing on creating a MVP for the end of the semester, so we will not be worrying about the optimization of the app quite yet.

## Observation 2: 
Observation Statement:
- After looking through the results of the focus group survey, I noticed the age group  that took the survey. The most popular age group was the ages 18 to 30 years old. Another thing that stood out was a lot of people travel with their family which means the prefer to travel as a group.

Supporting Data:
- Suporting data can be the people that chose the age group 18-30 years old almost all preffered to travel with their families
Team Action (if any):
- N/A
## Observation 2:
Observation Statement:
- Everyone who took the survey seem to be willing to spend about the same amount on their trips. I think pricing is the most important because it determines how committed someone is to really booking a trip. I noticed some people put some very unrealistic numbers. Also the requested addittional feautures were all very good ideas that people should consider when it comes to traveling.
- 
Supporting Data:
- Supporting data can be some peoples input was very unrealistic. It would be almost impossible to travel to somewhere like Japan and only spend between $0 - $500. 

Team Action (if any):
-N/A
