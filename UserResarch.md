## Observation 1:
Observation Statement:
- Most respondents expressed at least a slight willingness to try our product.

Supporting Data:
- Out of 17 total responses to the question of how willing the respondent would be to try out our product, 15 of them expressed at the very least a slight willingness to see how it works. They mentioned things such as liking the idea of a streamlined approach to planning vacations. Respondents did express slight concern about the app actually working and being helpful rather than a hindrance to the planning 
process, and also being free.

Team Action (if any):
- We will not be taking action on this observation because it is a positive one. At least to start, our appwill be free because we will not be putting any money into it. We also will be focusing on creating a MVP for the end of the semester, so we will not be worrying about the optimization of the app quite yet.

## Observation 2: 
Observation Statement:
- After looking through the results of the focus group survey, I noticed the age group  that took the survey. The most popular age group was the ages 18 to 30 years old. Another thing that stood out was a lot of people travel with their family which means the prefer to travel as a group.

Supporting Data:
- Suporting data can be the people that chose the age group 18-30 years old almost all preffered to travel with their families

Team Action (if any):
- N/A

## Observation 3:
Observation Statement:
- Everyone who took the survey seem to be willing to spend about the same amount on their trips. I think pricing is the most important because it determines how committed someone is to really booking a trip. I noticed some people put some very unrealistic numbers. Also the requested addittional feautures were all very good ideas that people should consider when it comes to traveling.

Supporting Data:
- Supporting data can be some peoples input was very unrealistic. It would be almost impossible to travel to somewhere like Japan and only spend between $0 - $500. 

Team Action (if any):
- N/A

## Observation 4 
Observation statement: 
- Users of 50 - 70 years of age both have different taste on what they want to do when it comes to vacation. From our data, our married couple would like to explore places while our user that is single, would just like to visit family.

Supporting Data: 
- On our survey, we received 2 responses from people in the age range of 50 - 70. One of them is married, the other one is single

Team Action (if any): 
- Maybe integrate a question on the personality test that asks the user what their marital status is, that way we can see what destination is feasable for them (if they are married or single).

## Observation 5
Observation statement: 
- Users currently use Google (both searches and documents) as well as the individual apps which we compete with to book vacations. This is the exact problem we wish to solve and 75% of our users likely experience it. 

Supporting Data: 
- Out of the 20 responses of our survey, 15 said they use either Google searches or one of our main competitors to plan trips.

Team Action (if any): 
- N/A

## Observation 6
Observation statement:
- Out of the twenty respondents, the vast majority travel between 1 - 3 times per year.

Supporting Data:
- 30% claim to travel once per year, 90% claim to travel 2 - 3 times per year.

Team Action (if any):
- N/A
