## Observation 5 (50 - 70 years of age)
- Observation statement: Users of 50 - 70 years of age both have different taste on what they want to do when it comes to vacation. From our data, our married couple would like to explore places while our user that is single, would just like to visit family.

- Supporting Data: On our survey, we received 2 responses from people in the age range of 50 - 70. One of them is married, the other one is single

- Team Action (if any): Maybe integrate a question on the personality test that asks the user what their marital status is, that way we can see what destination is feasable for them (if they are married or single).
