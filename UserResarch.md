## Observation 1:
- Observation Statement:

Most respondents expressed at least a slight willingness to try our product.

- Supporting Data:

Out of 17 total responses to the question of how willing the respondent would be to try out our product, 15 of them expressed at the very least a slight willingness to see how it works. They mentioned things such as liking the idea of a streamlined approach to planning vacations. Respondents did express slight concern about the app actually working and being helpful rather than a hindrance to the planning 
process, and also being free.

- Team Action (if any):

We will not be taking action on this observation because it is a positive one. At least to start, our appwill be free because we will not be putting any money into it. We also will be focusing on creating a MVP for the end of the semester, so we will not be worrying about the optimization of the app quite yet.
