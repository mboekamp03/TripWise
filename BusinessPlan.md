## Lean Canvas Process

The Lean Canvas is a streamlined, one-page business planning framework designed to help entrepreneurs and startups outline their business model in a concise manner. It focuses on key aspects such as problems facing customers, target audiences, customer relationships, revenue streams, and cost structure. This differs from the traditional 20 to 50 page business plans that take exceptionally long to read and write. Streamlining this appraoch into a breif yet important table simplies the process and end result (https://www.leancanvas.com).
