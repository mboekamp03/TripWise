# TripWise

## What is it?

Welcome to our all-encompassing travel companion! Unleash the power of seamless exploration with our app, where every 
aspect of your journey converges for the ultimate travel experience. From takeoff to touchdown, we're not just about 
booking â€“ we're your passport to a world of limitless possibilities.

This app was developed with the intent of creating a platform for planning a vacation where you can take a quiz to determine
where you should travel based on your wants for the destination, and do all of your booking
in one place - from travel to lodging to activities. We had about 8 weeks to create this app from planning to completion. 
We ended up with a minimum viable product of the implemented quiz to determine where to travel from a list of 10 destinations
across the country. We also connected a web API to browse available airbnbs in the destination chosen.

## How do I use it?

Tripwise uses a username and password authentication to log in and save details of the quiz answers. To make an account, an
email and password are needed. Soon after you sign up, you will receive an email to confirm your account. After confirming, 
you're ready to use our app! Your account ensures that your information and quiz answers will be saved between sessions. 

TripWise can be used to determine where you want to travel. To accomplish this, choose to take our quiz from the selection screen. 
The app takes your answers and uses an algorithm driven by cloud functions in order to match your wants to a destination from
our small, pre-selected list. 

You can also skip the quiz and simply choose a destination from our destination list to explore. We currently have functionality
to explore airbnbs in the area you want to travel to, and then to take you to the airbnb website to actually book your stay.

## Credits

We are a group of five students that created this app as a part of our Software Engineering Capstone class at URI. The idea for this app was to create
a place where people could decide for a trip where to go, where to stay, and what to do all in one place.  Our app was built using
Thunkable, a UI design tool to generate React Native code.
