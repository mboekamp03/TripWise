    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        We are a group of five students that created this app as a part of our Software Engineering class at URI. The idea for this app was to create
        a place where people could decide for a trip where to go, where to stay, and what to do all in one place. The current
        version of the app is our minimum viable product, where you can take the quiz to determine the best place for your
        wants, and find a place on AirBnB that you can stay in using web APIs connected to our app. Our app was built using
        Thunkable, a no-code platform to build software.
