        confidence.

    <h1>How can I get TripWise?</h1>
    <p>
        Currently, TripWise is navigating its inaugural phase of internal testing, marking the early milestones of its
        development journey. The team has recently completed crafting a quiz designed to pinpoint destinations most
        fitting to each customer's preferences. With a vision to evolve into an all-encompassing solution for travelers,
        TripWise aspires to seamlessly handle every facet of the booking process, spanning travel arrangements,
        accommodations, and activities. While the current functionality leans towards offering insightful suggestions,
        the ultimate objective is to seamlessly transition into a comprehensive booking platform.
